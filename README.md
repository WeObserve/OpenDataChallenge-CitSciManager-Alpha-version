# Sarjom

Name : Sarjom is the name given to the tree [Shorea robusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorea_robusta) in the "ho" language. Sarjom represents the guiding philosophy of our software development lifecycle. We want to grow slow like a tree while ensuring the growth and development of all other species, flora and fauna that make up our environment.
