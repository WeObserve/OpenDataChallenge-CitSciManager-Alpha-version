# Sarjom

Name : Sarjom is the name given to the tree [Shorea robusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorea_robusta) in the "ho" language. Sarjom represents the guiding philosophy of our software development lifecycle. We want to grow slow like a tree while ensuring the growth and development of all other species, flora and fauna that encompasses our environment.

## June 2020 - September 2020
Development is spread across individual branches/contributors. We merge changes every fortnight and release a stable build every every month.

## Areas of work
We are a research based lab, our goal is to first find out "gaps" in current systems and then use the most appropriate people and technologies to empower communties through open source development.
