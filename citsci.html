        <h1>About Citizen Science</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Citizen science is a very popular field of public engagement in
          scientific research, especially, related to environment and climate
          change. Almost anyone can help contribute to citizen science projects
          across the world by taking pictures, measurements and data about our
          environment and it includes air, water, soil, temperature and images
          of flora, fauna and wildlife. Your data contributions helps
          scientists, researchers and environment enthusiast to generate
          data-backed research and stories about our impact on climate and
          environment. You can find more about citizen science here,

          There are many more such cool projects all across the world. According
          to most recent research, there are approximately "between 1.36 million
          and 2.28 million people volunteer annually in the 388 projects we
          surveyed, though variation is great" and that "the range of in-kind
          contribution of the volunteerism in our 388 citizen science projects
          as between $667 million to $2.5 billion annually."(Theobald et al.
          2015)

        <h2>Why your contributions matters to us?</h2>
        <p>
          The Living Planet Report published by World Wildlife Fund (WWF, 2018)
          states that the world has seen a “60% decline in the size of
          populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians in just
          over 40 years”. The current rate of decline in wildlife population is
          the “worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs
          65 million years ago” (Doyle, 2019). The root cause of this tragedy is
          that “99 percent of currently threatened wildlife species are at risk
          due to human activities” (Dublin, 2019). The primary cause for
          wildlife extinction is in fact “human communities” (Van Dooren, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
          On November 2019, the European Parliament voted to declare a “climate
          emergency” (Rankin, 2019) on the backdrop of 11,258 scientists across
          153 countries publishing a report that warned the planet faces
          “clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency” (Freedman,
          2019). Even today, if we look deeply and with empathy to the current
          coronavirus crisis, we will find one of the root causes is the
          unethical treatment of wildlife animals in a wet market (Vox, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you went around your neighborhood and talked to people about the
          health of wildlife species in and around your neighborhood, very few
          will have an exact estimate or have access to the facts that we shared
          above. Wildlife, flora and fauna are extremely important for us, our
          families and our civilization because they help maintain a healthy
          ecological balance on Earth. Each living organism has a place in the
          food chain that contributes to the overall ecosystem. However, the
          natural habitat for wildlife has been adversely affected by the rapid
          human urbanization and there are very few avenues in modern life for
          us to actively engage and contribute with such issues in our day to
          day lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, we started this initiative to bring forward the conversation of
          climate change and environment back to the mainstream discussions. We
          want your data contributions for the sake of our environment and
          climate and we will create a platform where your data and voice will
          find a homely place.
